                <h1>History of Cigars</h1>
                <p>A cigar is a rolled bundle of dried and fermented tobacco leaves made to be smoked. They are produced in a wide variety of sizes and shapes. 
                Since the 20th century, almost all cigars are made of three distinct components: the filler, the binder leaf which holds the filler together, 
                and a wrapper leaf, which is often the best leaf used. Often there will be a cigar band printed with the cigar manufacturer's logo. Modern cigars often come with 2 bands, especially 
                Cuban Cigar bands, showing Limited Edition (Edición Limitada) bands displaying the year of production. Cigar tobacco is grown in significant quantities primarily in Central America 
                and the islands of the Caribbean, including Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, and Puerto Rico; 
                it is also produced in the Eastern United States, the Mediterranean countries of Italy and Spain (in the Canary Islands), and in Indonesia and the Philippines of Southeast Asia.

            <h1>Process of Cigars</h1>
            <p>Tobacco leaves are harvested and aged using a curing process that combines heat and shade to reduce sugar and water content without causing the larger leaves to rot. 
            This takes between 25 and 45 days, depending upon climatic conditions and the nature of sheds used to store harvested tobacco. Curing varies by type of tobacco and desired leaf color. 
            A slow fermentation follows, where temperature and humidity are controlled to enhance flavor, aroma, and burning characteristics while forestalling rot or disintegration. 
            The leaf will continue to be baled, inspected, un-baled, re-inspected, and baled again during the aging cycle. When it has matured to manufacturer's specifications it is sorted for appearance 
            and overall quality, and used as filler or wrapper accordingly. During this process, leaves are continually moistened to prevent damage.</p>

            <h1>Cigar Rolling</h1>
            <p>Quality cigars are still handmade. An experienced cigar-roller can produce hundreds of good, nearly identical cigars per day. The rollers keep the tobacco moist—especially 
            the wrapper—and use specially designed crescent-shaped knives, called chavetas, to form the filler and wrapper leaves quickly and accurately. Once rolled, the cigars are stored in 
            wooden forms as they dry, in which their uncapped ends are cut to a uniform size. From this stage, the cigar is a complete product that can be "laid down" and aged for decades if 
            kept as close to 21 °C (70 °F), and 70% relative humidity. Some cigars, especially premium brands, use different varieties of tobacco for the filler and the wrapper. Long filler 
            cigars are a far higher quality of cigar, using long leaves throughout. These cigars also use a third variety of tobacco leaf, called a "binder", between the filler and the outer wrapper. 
            This permits the makers to use more delicate and attractive leaves as a wrapper. These high-quality cigars almost always blend varieties of tobacco. Even Cuban long-filler cigars will 
            combine tobaccos from different parts of the island to incorporate several different flavors.</p>

            <h1>Process of Smoking Cigars</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Cutting: The cap end of a cigar must be cut or pierced for the cigar smoke to be drawn properly. Some cigar manufacturers purposely place different types of tobacco from one end
                to the other to give the cigar smokers a variety of tastes, body, and strength from start to finish. The basic types of cigar cuts are: Guillotine (or straight cut), Punch and V-Cuts.</li>
                <li>Lighting: The head, or cap, of the cigar is usually the end closest to the cigar band, the other the "foot". The band identifies the type of the cigar and may be removed or left on. 
                The smoker cuts or pierces the cap before lighting. The cigar should be rotated during lighting to achieve an even burn while slowly drawn with gentle puffs. If a match is used it should 
                be allowed to burn past its head before being put to the cigar, to avoid imparting unwelcome flavors or chemicals to the smoke. Many specialized gas and fluid lighters are made 
                for lighting cigars. The tip of the cigar should minimally touch any flame, with special care used with torch lighters to avoid charring the tobacco leaves.</li>
                <li>Flavors: Each brand and type of cigar has its unique taste. Whether a cigar is mild, medium, or full bodied does not correlate with quality. Among the factors which contribute to 
                the scent and flavor of cigar smoke are tobacco types and qualities used for filler, binder, and wrapper, age and aging method, humidity, production techniques (handmade vs. machine-made), 
                and added flavors. Among wrappers, darker tend to produce a sweetness, while lighter usually have a "drier", more neutral taste.</li>
                <li>Pairing: To enhance the experience of smoking a cigar, different types of pairings can be made. The most common pairings are: Rum, Wisky/Scotch, Wine, Draft Beers, and an espresso. However,
                the experience of smoking a cigar is very unique and the pairing combinations are limitless and differs from person to person. So, do not let these choices limit your experience and experiment with anything 
                you desire.</li>
